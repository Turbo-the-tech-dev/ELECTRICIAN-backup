# MEP Resources

Welcome to the MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) section of the ELECTRICIAN project! This directory contains resources that bridge electrical work with mechanical and plumbing systems in construction projects.

## Overview

MEP systems are integrated building systems that work together to provide comfortable, safe, and efficient building operations. Electrical professionals working on MEP projects must understand how electrical systems interface with mechanical and plumbing systems. This section provides resources to help electrical professionals collaborate effectively on integrated building projects.
