# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 2: Labor is the Killer — Understanding NEMA Labor Units

---

There is a saying in the trades: *Material will bankrupt you slowly. Labor will bankrupt you overnight.*

Material is knowable. You can get a quote, lock a price, track an invoice. Even when copper spikes, you can see it coming and plan around it. Labor is different. Labor is a living, breathing variable that changes based on the worker, the weather, the height of the ceiling, the congestion of the site, the phase of the moon. Labor is where estimates go to die.

This chapter gives you a framework for pricing labor that goes beyond "how many hours does this take?" into the more important question: *how many hours does this take, here, under these conditions, with these workers, in this sequence?*

## What Are NEMA Labor Units?

The **NEMA Labor Unit Manual** (produced by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, now largely maintained through NECA — the National Electrical Contractors Association) is the standard reference for estimating the time required to install electrical components.

A **labor unit** is expressed in tenths of an hour (man-hours per unit of work). For example:

| Task | NEMA Labor Unit |
|------|----------------|
| Install duplex receptacle, conduit system | 0.5 hours each |
| Install 4" EMT conduit (per 10 feet) | 0.8 hours |
| Terminate wire at panelboard, #12 AWG | 0.1 hours each |
| Install 2x4 fluorescent troffer, recessed | 0.7 hours each |
| Pull 3 conductors #12 AWG in conduit (per 100 ft) | 0.8 hours |
| Install 100A circuit breaker in panel | 0.4 hours each |
| Install 200A single-phase service entrance | 12.0 hours |

These units represent **base-level conditions**: an experienced journeyman, working at grade, in a new construction environment, with good access and no unusual obstructions, during normal day shift, in average weather.

Real jobs are rarely at base-level conditions.

## The Fully Burdened Labor Rate

Before we get to multipliers, we need to understand what an "hour of labor" actually costs you.

Many contractors price labor using the journeyman's base wage. This is a critical mistake. The **fully burdened rate** includes every cost associated with putting a worker on a job:

**Base wage** (e.g., $38.00/hr)
**+ FICA (Social Security & Medicare):** ~7.65% = $2.91
**+ FUTA/SUTA (unemployment insurance):** ~2–4% = ~$1.14
**+ General liability insurance:** ~$2–6/hr depending on classification
**+ Workers' compensation:** varies widely; electrical can be 8–15% of payroll
**+ Health insurance contribution:** ~$3–8/hr
**+ Pension/401(k) contribution:** ~$1–4/hr
**+ Tool allowance and small tools:** ~$0.50–1.00/hr
**+ Vehicle costs allocated to field:** varies

On a $38.00/hr journeyman, the true fully burdened rate is often **$58–$72/hr** or more before you even add overhead and profit.

If you are pricing labor at the straight wage, you are subsidizing the job with your own overhead. Every hour you sell at wage cost without burden is an hour you are losing money.

Know your fully burdened rate. Update it every time your payroll costs change.

## Job Condition Multipliers

NEMA units assume ideal conditions. Real jobs have conditions. Here is how to adjust:

### Height Multipliers

Working above 10 feet significantly reduces productivity. Workers slow down. Ladders are repositioned constantly. Scissor lifts must be staged and moved. Material handling becomes more complex.

| Working Height | Multiplier |
|---------------|-----------|
| 0–10 ft (ground level) | 1.00 (base) |
| 10–15 ft | 1.10 |
| 15–20 ft | 1.20 |
| 20–25 ft | 1.35 |
| 25–30 ft | 1.50 |
| 30+ ft (boom lift required) | 1.70–2.00+ |

A warehouse job with 30-foot ceilings doesn't just cost more in equipment. The labor to install every conduit run, every fixture, every junction box above 20 feet is genuinely slower. Apply the multiplier to all affected tasks.

### Weather and Temperature

Outdoor work — site lighting, underground, service entrance work — is affected by temperature extremes and precipitation.

| Condition | Multiplier |
|-----------|-----------|
| Ideal (65–80°F, no precipitation) | 1.00 |
| Hot (above 90°F) | 1.10–1.20 |
| Cold (below 32°F) | 1.15–1.25 |
| Extreme cold (below 10°F) | 1.40–1.60 |
| Rain (light, intermittent) | 1.10 |
| Snow/ice | 1.25–1.50 |

Cold weather affects both the worker and the materials. PVC conduit becomes brittle. Wire insulation stiffens. Gloves slow fine motor tasks. Factor it in for winter schedules.

### Congestion and Site Access

**Congestion** refers to how difficult it is to move materials and workers through the job site. New construction with open structure is the base condition. Renovation work in occupied buildings is often two to three times more difficult.

| Site Condition | Multiplier |
|---------------|-----------|
| Open new construction | 1.00 |
| Partially occupied building | 1.20–1.35 |
| Fully occupied (hospital, school in session) | 1.50–1.75 |
| Renovation in tight/confined spaces | 1.50–2.00 |
| Existing ceiling systems to work above | 1.25–1.50 |
| Asbestos/hazardous material present (controlled work) | 1.50–2.00+ |

Working in an occupied hospital during normal business hours — navigating patient areas, maintaining noise/dust controls, working in 2x2 ceilings above sensitive areas — is fundamentally different work than new construction. Price it accordingly.

### Shift Work and Overtime

Work performed outside of normal day shift incurs additional productivity loss beyond just the wage premium:

| Shift | Productivity Loss (beyond wage premium) |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Normal day shift | 0% |
| Evening shift (3–11 PM) | 5–10% |
| Night shift (11 PM–7 AM) | 10–20% |
| 10-hour days (4 days/week) | 5–8% by week 4+ |
| 6-day weeks | 10–15% by week 3+ |
| 7-day weeks | 25%+ after week 2 |

Extended overtime reduces productivity through accumulated fatigue. The NEMA studies on overtime productivity are widely referenced in the industry and show significant output decline on sustained overtime schedules. Don't just add the overtime premium wage — add the productivity loss too.

### Foreman Time

On any job with a foreman who is not personally swinging tools (a "non-working foreman"), that foreman's time must be fully accounted for in your labor estimate. Foreman time includes:
- Planning and layout
- Material coordination and receiving
- Safety documentation (toolbox talks, incident reports)
- Coordination with GC and other trades
- Crew supervision

For a 5-person crew with a non-working foreman, you are carrying 20% of your field labor in pure overhead. This is not captured in the NEMA unit for installing a receptacle. It must be added separately.

---

## Combining Multipliers

When multiple adverse conditions exist simultaneously, the multipliers are typically **compounded** (multiplied together), not simply added.

**Example:** Occupied hospital renovation, above 20 feet, during winter:
- Height multiplier (20–25 ft): 1.35
- Occupied building: 1.60
- Cold weather (below 32°F): 1.20

**Combined multiplier:** 1.35 × 1.60 × 1.20 = **2.59**

That means a task that takes 1.0 hours at base conditions takes 2.59 hours under these combined conditions. If your estimate used the NEMA unit without adjustment, you bid 1 hour and you're going to spend 2.59. That's a 159% labor overrun on every task in those conditions.

This is how otherwise experienced contractors lose money on renovation work.

## Building Your Own Historical Labor Database

NEMA units are a starting point, not a final answer. Your goal is to develop **your own** labor factors based on the actual performance of your crews.

After every significant job, run a labor analysis:
1. Pull the estimated hours by task category (conduit, wire, devices, panels, etc.)
2. Pull the actual hours from timesheets, coded by task
3. Calculate your actual productivity factor vs. the estimate

Over time, you will see patterns. Your crews may consistently run 90% of NEMA on straight conduit work (you're more efficient than average) and 130% of NEMA on above-ceiling wire pulls in tight spaces (you're slower than average). These patterns are your real labor factors.

A simple spreadsheet tracking this data on 10 to 20 jobs will start giving you meaningful adjustments. After 50 jobs across different types, you have a genuine competitive advantage in your estimating.

## Case Study: The $80,000 Labor Mistake

A mid-size electrical contractor bid a 60,000 sq ft medical office building. The estimator used base NEMA units throughout. The job had the following conditions:

- Fully occupied during construction (phased renovation)
- Work above 10-foot ceilings in existing building
- 6-day workweeks mandated by the GC's schedule

The estimator applied no multipliers. He bid 4,800 labor hours at a fully burdened rate of $62/hr = **$297,600 in labor**.

Actual performance:
- Occupancy multiplier: 1.50
- Height multiplier: 1.15
- 6-day week productivity loss: 1.12
- Combined: 1.50 × 1.15 × 1.12 = **1.93**

Actual hours needed: 4,800 × 1.93 = **9,264 hours**

At $62/hr fully burdened, actual labor cost: **$574,368**

The labor shortfall alone was **$276,768**. After the job, the contractor reported a final loss of approximately $200,000 (some scope additions helped offset part of the gap). The contractor questioned why he was losing money when his crews "did everything right."

His crews did do everything right. His estimate didn't.

Labor is not the enemy. Unpriced labor is. Know your conditions, apply your multipliers, build your history, and price the job you are actually going to execute — not the ideal version of it.
