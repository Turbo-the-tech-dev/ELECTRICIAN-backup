# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 7: Writing the Letter — The Proposal That Protects You

---

After all the work — the takeoff, the labor pricing, the overhead calculation, the material quotes — most contractors spend 20 minutes writing the actual proposal. They type a lump sum into a one-paragraph email, attach a number, and hit send.

Then they wonder why, six months later, they are in a dispute about what was included.

Your proposal is not a formality at the end of the estimating process. It is a **legal and commercial document** that defines the scope of your obligation, limits your liability, and sets the terms under which you will perform and be paid. A poorly written proposal can override every smart thing you did during the estimate. A well-written proposal protects every dollar of margin you worked to build.

This chapter teaches you how to write a proposal that wins work and protects you when things go sideways.

## The Anatomy of a Professional Electrical Proposal

A complete commercial electrical proposal has eight sections:

### 1. Header: Project Identification
- Project name and address
- General Contractor / Owner name and contact
- Bid date and proposal number (sequential, for your records)
- Your company name, license number, address, contact information
- Reference to the specific drawing set and specification version you priced

**Why it matters:** Disputes about what drawings you bid from are common. "We used Rev 2 drawings issued January 14th" is a defensible position. "We bid from the current drawings" is not.

---

### 2. Base Bid Price

State your total base bid clearly:

> "Pursuant to the above-referenced drawings and specifications, we propose to furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and supervision necessary to complete the electrical scope of work as described herein, for the sum of:

> **FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($422,500)**"

Write the number in both words and numerals. This eliminates any ambiguity about what the number is.

---

### 3. Scope of Work — Inclusions

Briefly describe what is included in your base bid. This does not need to be a comprehensive paragraph — it needs to be specific enough to establish what the bid covers:

> "Base bid includes complete electrical rough-in and finish for the building as shown on Electrical Drawings E0.1 through E5.3, dated January 14, 2025, including but not limited to: service entrance, power distribution, lighting, power, motor connections for HVAC equipment, exit and emergency lighting, and temporary power as shown."

---

### 4. Scope of Work — Exclusions (CRITICAL)

This is the most important section of the proposal. List every category of work that is **not** in your price. The exclusions section is your first defense against scope creep and scope disputes.

**Standard exclusions to consider on every commercial proposal:**

**Systems (by specialty contractor unless otherwise noted):**
- Fire alarm and fire detection systems
- Nurse call and patient monitoring systems
- Building automation and direct digital controls (DDC)
- Access control, security, and surveillance systems
- Audio/visual and presentation systems
- Structured cabling (Cat5/6, fiber optic, telephone)
- Public address systems
- Intrusion detection

**Scope limitations:**
- Core drilling through structural concrete (unless included in base scope)
- Concrete cutting, patching, painting, and restoration
- Underground directional boring
- Hazardous material (asbestos, lead) identification, removal, or abatement
- Arc flash hazard analysis and labeling (unless included)
- Coordination/power quality studies

**Owner-provided items:**
- Owner-furnished equipment (OFE) connections (include connections, exclude equipment)
- Items shown as "by owner" or "NIC" on drawings

**Schedule and addenda:**
- Work shown on addenda issued after [bid date] (list specific addenda you included)
- Any addenda not listed above are excluded and are subject to additional cost

**Specific drawing or specification conflicts:**
- "Our bid is based on Electrical Drawings. Where conflicts exist between drawings and specifications, our bid covers the lesser cost option. Any required work exceeding the drawing scope is subject to change order."

---

### 5. Clarifications and Qualifications

Clarifications address specific ambiguities or assumptions in the drawings or specifications that affect your price. Write these clearly and specifically:

> "**Clarification 1:** Electrical room on Level 2 (Room 245) shows a 400A, 3-phase panel on the electrical drawings but a 600A panel on the one-line diagram. Our bid is based on the 400A panel shown on the floor plan. Cost of upgrading to 600A is available upon request."

> "**Clarification 2:** Specification Section 26 00 00 calls for IMC conduit throughout. Our bid is based on EMT in dry locations and IMC where noted, per industry standard. Full IMC specification compliance is available as an alternate."

> "**Clarification 3:** We have not included an allowance for temporary power. If required, temporary power installation and monthly billing can be provided under a separate scope."

Each clarification establishes your assumption in the record. If the final contract requires the more expensive option, you have a written basis for a change order.

---

### 6. Alternates (if applicable)

Many bids request **alternate pricing** — additions or deductions from the base scope. Present alternates clearly:

> **Alternate 1 — Upgrade to 600A panel in Room 245:** ADD $8,400
> **Alternate 2 — Full IMC compliance throughout:** ADD $31,200
> **Alternate 3 — Deduct site lighting (to be bid separately):** DEDUCT $18,500

---

### 7. Bid Validity and Escalation Terms

> "This proposal is valid for **thirty (30) days** from the date above, after which pricing is subject to revision."

> "Material pricing is based on current pricing as of the date of this proposal. In the event of a copper price change exceeding ten percent (10%) between the proposal date and material buyout, contractor reserves the right to adjust material pricing accordingly."

Bid validity periods are critical on projects that are not awarded quickly. A proposal with no validity period is a commitment with no expiration. If material prices move, if your labor costs increase, if your bonding situation changes — a 30-day validity period lets you revisit the number.

---

### 8. Payment Terms

> "Payment terms: Net 30 from invoice date, per schedule of values to be submitted prior to start of work. Retainage of 10% on each draw, released upon substantial completion unless otherwise negotiated."

> "Work beyond the contract scope requires written authorization prior to performance. Change orders are payable at invoice + 15% overhead and profit on labor and material cost."

> "Contractor reserves all lien rights under [State] law. Failure to receive payment within [X] days of invoice date may result in work suspension upon [X] days' written notice."

## What a GC Reads First

When a GC's estimator receives multiple electrical proposals, their first move is usually:

1. **Compare the bottom-line numbers** — who is low, who is high, by how much
2. **Read the exclusions list** — are there scope gaps that explain the price difference?
3. **Look for qualifications that shift risk** — escalation clauses, validity periods, exclusions from spec compliance

A GC who is doing their job will level your bid against others: "Contractor A is $50,000 lower than Contractor B, but Contractor A excluded fire alarm rough-in, which is $35,000. Contractor B's number is actually comparable."

If your exclusions list is complete and accurate, you will survive bid leveling even when you're not the lowest number. If your proposal is vague, the GC will assume your exclusions are in your scope — and when you try to bill for them later, you will be in a dispute over a proposal that doesn't protect you.

---

## Responding to Bid Leveling

When a GC calls you to "level your bid," they are often trying to do one of two things:
1. Fairly understand your assumptions so they can evaluate your number against others
2. Use the leveling conversation to pressure you into reducing your price or adding scope for free

**How to respond to legitimate leveling:**
- Explain each clarification and exclusion clearly
- Provide additional pricing for items the GC needs included
- Do not arbitrarily reduce your number — your number is what it is based on your cost

**How to respond to price pressure:**
- "Our number is based on our actual cost. We don't have pricing to give."
- "If you can show me a scope difference between our number and the next, I can price the delta."
- "We can look at value engineering options — is there flexibility in the spec?"

The contractor who reduces their price under GC pressure without changing scope is not winning — they are training GCs to pressure them on every future bid. Hold your number unless there is a legitimate scope or specification adjustment.

The proposal letter is the last thing you write and the first thing the owner or GC reads. It is what they sign. It is what they enforce. It is what you defend your work with when a dispute arises.

Write it like it matters. Because it does.
