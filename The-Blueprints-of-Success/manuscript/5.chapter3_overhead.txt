# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 3: The Invisible Costs — Overhead You're Probably Forgetting

---

Ask a new contractor what goes into an electrical estimate and they will say: wire, conduit, devices, panels, and labor. They are not wrong. They are just incomplete. The items they listed are the visible costs — the ones on the takeoff sheet, the ones that show up on the material invoice.

The invisible costs are everything else. And "everything else" is often the difference between making money and wondering what happened.

This chapter is a deliberate, systematic walk through the costs that experienced contractors forget and new contractors don't know to include. Some of these line items are small individually. Together, they can represent 8–15% of job cost — cost you haven't priced, margin you won't see.

## Category 1: Permit Fees and Inspection Costs

### Permit Fees

Every commercial electrical job requires a permit. The cost varies enormously by jurisdiction: a small city might charge $500 for a commercial permit, while a major metropolitan jurisdiction might charge $15,000 or more for a hospital or industrial project. These fees are calculated on different bases:
- Flat fee per job type
- Fee based on total contract value (typically 0.5–1.5%)
- Fee based on connected load (per amp)
- Fee based on square footage

**Don't estimate — look it up.** Call the jurisdiction or check their fee schedule online. On a $500,000 electrical contract, a 1% permit fee is $5,000. If you forgot to include it, that's $5,000 of overhead you are absorbing from margin.

### Inspection Fees

Some jurisdictions charge separately for each inspection (rough-in, above ceiling, service, final). Others include it in the permit fee. Clarify before bid.

### Plan Review Fees

Large commercial projects may require an electrical plan review as part of permitting. This is a separate fee, sometimes charged by a third-party reviewer, and is often not included in the basic permit cost.

### Expedited Review

If the schedule requires a fast-track permit, expedited review can cost two to three times the standard fee. Know whether the project schedule demands this and price accordingly.

## Category 2: Equipment Rentals

### Scissor Lifts

Any job with work above 12–14 feet that lacks scaffolding will require a scissor lift for device installation, conduit work, and fixture hanging. Scissor lifts cost:
- **Day rental:** $200–$350/day (electric)
- **Week rental:** $600–$900/week
- **Monthly:** $1,500–$2,200/month

For a six-month job with work above 12 feet throughout, you are looking at $9,000–$13,200 in scissor lift cost alone. This is not a small number.

### Boom Lifts (Man Lifts)

Warehouses, manufacturing facilities, gymnasiums — any structure with ceilings above 25–30 feet needs a boom lift for certain tasks. A 40-foot boom lift rents for:
- **Day:** $350–$600/day
- **Week:** $1,200–$2,000/week
- **Month:** $3,500–$5,500/month

In an arena or distribution center, boom lift cost can be a six-figure line item on a single project.

### Scaffolding

Some high-work projects (stairwells, atriums, high-bay buildings with fixed fixtures) require rolling scaffolding or erected scaffold systems. Scaffold rental includes delivery, setup, and teardown charges that must be included in your estimate.

### Forklift

Material staging and panel delivery on large sites sometimes requires a forklift for unloading and positioning. If the GC is not providing one, this is your cost.

## Category 3: Fuel, Vehicle, and Transportation

### Fuel

Every trip to the job site burns fuel. With a crew of four in two vans, driving 20 miles round trip, at current fuel prices — this is a real cost. For a six-month project:
- 2 vehicles × 5 days/week × 26 weeks = 260 vehicle trips
- 20 miles/trip × $0.20/mile operating cost = $4.00/trip
- 260 trips × $4.00 = **$1,040 in fuel alone**

On larger jobs with material delivery runs, supply house runs, and service calls, this number grows significantly.

### Vehicle Wear and Maintenance

Every mile driven wears your trucks. IRS mileage rates reflect the true all-in cost of vehicle operation: depreciation, tires, oil, maintenance. Use the full mileage rate, not just fuel cost, when calculating vehicle expense.

### Material Delivery and Freight

Not all material arrives at the job site automatically. Some material gets delivered from the supply house with a delivery charge. Large gear (switchgear, transformers, large panels) may require specialized freight delivery with lift gate service and premium rates. Underground conduit deliveries may require flatbed trucks.

Get delivery quotes on large material orders and include them in your bid.

## Category 4: Tools and Consumables

### Small Tools

The NEMA labor unit system assumes small tools are included in the labor rate. If you have not built small tool cost into your fully burdened rate, you need to add it as a direct job cost. Industry standard is approximately **2.5–3% of direct labor cost** for small tools and consumables.

Small tools include:
- Drill bits (bit cost is enormous on concrete and masonry work)
- Hole saws
- Fishing equipment (rods, fish tape, string)
- Tie wire and cable ties
- Spray paint and markers
- Tape (duct, electrical, Teflon)
- Conduit bending lubricant
- Grinding wheels and cutting discs
- Wire nuts, wire markers, shrink tube
- PPE consumables (gloves, safety glasses, masks)

### Specialty Tooling

If a job requires specialized tools you don't own — a pipe threading machine for large conduit, a hydraulic knockout set, a cable puller for long underground runs — add the rental cost or purchase cost for that specific job.

### Powder-Actuated Tools

Fastening systems using powder-actuated tools require powder charges and pins as consumables. These costs are real, they are per-shot, and on a job with significant concrete or steel fastening, they add up.

## Category 5: Non-Productive Labor Time

This is perhaps the most commonly overlooked category in electrical estimating: labor that is expended but produces no installed work.

### Mobilization and Demobilization

The first day a crew arrives on a new job, significant time is spent setting up: reviewing plans with the foreman, meeting with the GC superintendent, staging the materials, setting up the material storage area. None of this installs a single foot of conduit, but it is real labor cost.

Similarly, job closeout — cleaning up, removing temporary equipment, organizing materials for final delivery — is non-productive labor that must be priced.

### Safety Meetings and Documentation

Most commercial GCs require weekly safety meetings (toolbox talks). OSHA regulations require documented safety training for specific hazards. On union jobs, there may be required daily safety huddles. A 20-minute safety meeting with a five-person crew every Monday is 1.67 labor hours per week — over a six-month project, that's 43 labor hours of non-productive time.

### Travel Time

If your contract requires you to pay travel time (most union agreements do), this is a direct labor cost on every job. A crew that spends 30 minutes traveling each way is costing you one hour per man per day in travel pay. On a 5-person crew for 130 working days, that's 650 man-hours — roughly $40,000 at full burden rates.

### Job Superintendent / Site PM Time

If you have a project manager or site superintendent who spends time on this project — attending OAC meetings, reviewing submittals, coordinating deliveries, processing RFIs and change orders — that time is a job cost. It is not captured in the NEMA units for installing receptacles.

### Cleanup

Most GC contracts require daily cleanup of your work area. On a large job with an active crew, this is 15–30 minutes per worker per day. It is labor cost that produces no installed work.

## Category 6: Temporary Power and Lighting

When a project requires temporary electrical service during construction — either for your tools and other trades, or as a GC requirement — the cost may fall to you if you are the designated electrical contractor.

This includes:
- Temporary service installation (meter, panel, feeder)
- Temporary power distribution (pigtails, spider boxes, GFCIs)
- Temporary lighting (job site strings, fixtures)
- Monthly power cost (if allocated to your contract)
- Removal and restoration at end of project

On a large project where temporary power is required for 18 months, this is a significant line item. Clarify in the GC's contract and scope documents whether temporary power is included or excluded before you bid.

---

## Category 7: Closeout and Documentation

Getting paid on the final draw requires project closeout documentation. This work is often under-estimated:

- **As-built drawings:** Marking up the contract drawings with field changes, relocated devices, actual conduit routing. On a complex job, this can take 10–40 man-hours.
- **O&M manuals:** Many contracts require operations and maintenance manuals for installed equipment. Compiling these from manufacturer data takes time.
- **Test and inspection reports:** HVAC coordinated testing, fire alarm system testing, power quality documentation — each requires labor time.
- **Lien releases:** Preparing and obtaining lien releases from suppliers and subcontractors for the GC's final payment package.

## Calculating Your True Burden Rate

The **burden rate** is the ratio of overhead to direct labor. It tells you how much indirect cost you are carrying for every dollar of direct labor you pay.

**Formula:**
Burden Rate = Total Annual Overhead ÷ Total Annual Direct Labor Payroll

If your company pays $1,200,000 in direct field labor annually, and your annual overhead (office rent, vehicles, insurance, admin staff, etc.) is $480,000, your burden rate is:

$480,000 ÷ $1,200,000 = **40%**

This means for every dollar of direct labor, you need $0.40 to cover overhead. This burden is applied to every hour of labor in your estimate, in addition to the direct wage cost.

The invisible costs won't show up in your takeoff. They won't be on a material quote. Nobody will remind you to include them. It is entirely on you to remember they exist, price them honestly, and make them part of every estimate.

The contractor who does this consistently is the contractor who always seems to know exactly where his money went.
