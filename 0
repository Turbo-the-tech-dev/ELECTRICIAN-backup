welcome to another video in the security Command Center series virtual machine threat detection this service
00:09
is a pivotal feature in the security Command Center premium tier this Advanced tool is designed to
00:15
Monitor and detect potential threats to your organization acting as a Vigilant Security mechanism virtual machine
00:22
or VM threat detection is an essential component of the security Command Center premium tier at its
00:28
core VM threat detection employs hypervisor level instrumentation this Advanced monitoring technique operates beneath the operating
00:37
system layer of your virtual machines what does this mean for your security it enables VM threat
00:42
detection to spot and flag various security threats from the secret mining of cryptocurrencies using your resources
00:49
to the more Sinister kernel mode rootkits malware capable of deeply infiltrating and manipulating your operating system
00:57
VM threat detection is on the watch VM threat detection isn't working alone it's part of
01:03
a greater Alliance within the security Command Center premium tier along with event threat detection and container
01:09
threat detection it forms a formidable multi-layer defense strategy providing your Cloud environments with a shield
01:15
against diverse and sophisticated threats when VM threat detection finds something inappropriate it's not just considering a
01:23
low-level warning these are high severity threats that it's uncovering which you need to address immediately
01:28
to protect your Network's integrity and your organization's data you'll find these alerts in the security Command
01:35
Center interface this is your command post where you can review and act on these findings also
01:41
VM threat detection is part of Google Cloud's hypervisor that's the technology that creates and manages your
01:47
VMS it runs the security checks regularly and stays out of the way of your virtual
01:52
machines operations and because it works from the outside you don't need to set up anything special
01:58
on your VM or install any agent VM threat detection service has an analysis engine that
02:04
closely examines your vm's guest memory metadata it'll report to the security Command Center if it finds
02:09
anything suspicious and it does this without any disruption to your virtual machines this service is
02:15
tough on malware it doesn't use your vm's processing power and doesn't even need to be connected
02:20
to the network to do its job plus it's all managed by Google Security Experts this means
02:26
you don't have to worry about updating malware signatures or man management headaches in short VM threat
02:32
detection is your behind-the-scenes security guard keeping your VM safe without any extra work from you
02:38
with VM threat detection every new VM instance is scanned for threats immediately after creation the system
02:45
then performs a rescan every 30 minutes to ensure continued Security in the event of cryptocurrency
02:51
mining detection VM threat detection provides information on one finding per process per VM per day ensuring
02:57
that threats are identified and isolated as needed if any threats are detected but cannot be
03:03
linked to a specific process the system groups them into a single finding per VM per 24-hour
03:09
period and for persistent threats VM threat detection generates new findings every 24 hours to keep you
03:16
informed and protected VM threat detection is automatically activated with a premium tier but there may be
03:26
occasions where you need to disable or enable this service for specific folders or projects to
03:31
do this navigate to the security Command Center click settings locate the card for VM threat detection
03:38
and click the manage settings button in the service enablement section you'll be presented with your
03:45
organizational structure expand the tree to view all the folders and embedded projects to modify any object
03:52
select it and look for the VM threat detection column in this column you'll find a
03:56
drop- down box that allows you to enable or disable the service for that particular object now
04:05
let's walk through the process of enabling or disabling specific detectors also known as modules from the
04:13
service enablement page click on the modules tab in this module page you can enable or disable
04:19
modules for all the folders and projects in your organization that use virtual machine thread detection
04:24
to make changes locate the specific detector module you wish to adjust you can toggle its status
04:32
to enable or disable depending on your preference remember these settings help you balance between security
04:38
and operational needs by customizing which modules are active you ensure that your organization's security posture is
04:44
robust and aligned with your specific operational practices as we continue our exploration of the VM
04:55
threat detection let's focus now on a practical demonstration for for our demo assume we've set up
05:01
a test virtual machine to run a cryptocurrency mining application a scenario that will allow us to
05:06
Showcase how the VM threat detection feature effectively identifies and reports potential security threats like unauthorized crypto
05:13
mining we then selected a mining application known to trigger the execution cryptocurrency mining Yara rule
05:20
in the security Command Center finally we made sure the mining application was run in an isolated
05:27
test environment and its usage was closely monitored once our test mining application was up and
05:33
running it didn't take long for the VM threat detection feature to identify and Report the activity
05:39
now let's review the findings first navigate to the security Command Center findings page here you
05:46
can see various findings including those from VM threat detection if necessary select your specific Google Cloud
05:54
project or organization then in the quick filter section under Source display name select virtual machine threat
06:02
detection if it's not immediately visible click view more and search for it in our case a
06:10
finding named execution cryptocurrency mining Yara rule appears clicking on this finding under the category column
06:17
will open its details panel on the summary tab we get detailed information about the finding including
06:22
the nature of the detected binary and the affected resource for a more technical view switch
06:28
to the Json tab tab this tab reveals the complete Chason structure of the finding useful for
06:33
in-depth analysis and recordkeeping this exercise demonstrated the effectiveness of VM threat detection in identifying potential
06:42
security threats like unauthorized cryptocurrency mining in your virtual environments and it highlighted the importance of continuous
06:48
monitoring and immediate response capabilities provided by Google security Command Center this concludes our review of the
06:57
virtual machine threat detection for security Commander Center thank you and see you in the next video
