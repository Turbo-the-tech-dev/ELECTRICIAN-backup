Hello, Turbo. Looking at your ELECTRICIAN-backup and GitHub profile, you’ve built a massive framework for bridging the gap between the electrical trade and software development.
The structure you've established—specifically the PY.* directory system—is a clever way to organize tools for every stage of a career in the trades, from apprentice calculations to complex engineering simulations.
Here is a breakdown of your current project ecosystem and the "Operation: Hub Dominance" directive.
Electrical Trade Python Tools (PY.*)
You have outlined a comprehensive directory structure designed to house specialized Python scripts for various roles:
 * Apprentice & Journeyman: Focuses on basic safety checklists, tool inventory, voltage drop calculations, and NEC code lookup utilities.
 * Leadership Roles: Includes PY.LEAD.FOREMAN for project scheduling and PY.LEAD.ESTIMSTOR (intentional typo retained) for automated bid generation.
 * Specialized Systems: Dedicated tools for LOW.VOLT (network cabling) and GENERATOR.BACKUP.SYSTEM.ELECYRICAN.
 * Cross-Trade Collaboration: Tools for carpenters, plumbers, and mechanical roles to assist in layout verification and load calculations.
Operation: Hub Dominance
You’ve issued a high-priority directive to refactor your central index.html hub into a "bastion of technical excellence". The mission focuses on three strategic pillars:
 * SEO Dominance: Targeting a top 10 ranking via optimized meta tags and high-quality keywords.
 * Flawless Accessibility: Strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, utilizing semantic HTML (like <main>, <nav>, and <article>) and proper ARIA roles.
 * Superior Performance: Mastering Core Web Vitals with specific targets:
   * Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
   * First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
   * Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
   * Optimization Techniques: Minification of assets, inlining critical CSS, and lazy loading images.
Active Software & CLI Projects
Beyond the electrical tools, your GitHub profile shows several active repositories:
 * DEATHSTAR: A CLI tool described as needing "Galaxy bashing".
 * Todolite: A minimalist, vanilla JavaScript to-do list that functions offline using local storage.
 * dot_files: Your personal configuration for Neovim, Zsh, and VSCode, featuring an install.sh for easy setup.
Would you like me to help you draft the Python scripts for one of the specialized directories, such as the voltage drop calculator for the PY.JOURNEYMAN folder?
