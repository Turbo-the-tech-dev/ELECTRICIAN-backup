# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 5: Scope Creep — The Silent Profit Killer

---

You priced the job right. Your takeoff was thorough. Your labor multipliers were accurate. Your overhead was fully loaded. You won the bid at a fair margin and you felt good about it.

Then the GC superintendent walked up to your foreman on a Tuesday morning and said: "Hey, can your guys add a couple circuits in the break room?" And your foreman said "Sure." And nobody wrote a change order. And that happened fourteen more times over six months.

At the end of the job, you wonder why you only made 4% instead of 12%.

You didn't lose that margin on the bid. You gave it away one "no big deal" at a time. This is **scope creep**, and it is the most persistent and least-discussed profit killer in the electrical contracting business.

## What Is Scope Creep?

Scope creep is the gradual expansion of project scope beyond what was defined — and priced — at the time of contract. It takes many forms:

- **Direct verbal requests:** "Can you add an outlet here?"
- **Implied coordination:** "We assumed your guys would rough-in for the low voltage contractor."
- **Addenda that expand without acknowledgment:** Changes issued after bid that increase scope without a formal adjustment to the contract price
- **Interpretation disputes:** "The drawings show it this way, but the spec says something different — you're responsible for the more expensive option."
- **Other trade problems becoming your work:** "The plumber moved that wall, so the conduit run you already installed has to move."

In all of these scenarios, the GC benefits from your additional work. In many of them, the GC knows exactly what is happening and is betting that you won't push back.

## Why GCs Rely on Scope Creep

This is not an accusation — it is a structural reality. General contractors are also squeezed on margin. Owners push for low prices. Change orders are scrutinized. Every dollar a GC can transfer to a sub through unclear scope language or unapproved verbal direction is a dollar they don't have to bill to the owner.

GCs who manage scope creep skillfully are not necessarily acting in bad faith. Many of them operate in a gray zone where they genuinely believe certain work is in your scope. Some of them know it isn't and are testing whether you will notice.

The electrician who consistently absorbs extras without billing for them trains GCs to expect it. The electrician who consistently processes change orders trains GCs to respect their contracts.

You want to be the second electrician.

## Identifying Work Not in the Prints

The first defense against scope creep is knowing exactly what is and is not in your contract.

### Read Your Contract Scope of Work Section

Before you start work, read your subcontract carefully. The scope section should define what electrical work is included. If it is vague — "all electrical work shown on drawings and specifications" — you need to identify every ambiguity before you start, not after.

Common scope traps in GC subcontract language:
- "All work necessary to complete the project" (unlimited scope)
- "Coordinate with other trades as required" (could mean anything)
- "Furnish and install all electrical systems" without excluding specialty systems you haven't priced

### Compare the Drawings to What You Priced

Keep a copy of the drawing set you used to bid the job. When new drawings or revised sheets are issued during construction, compare them to your bid set. Any new work is an extra. Mark it. Price it. Send a change order.

### Watch for Verbal Direction

The single most common pathway for scope creep is verbal instruction from a GC superintendent to your foreman. "Just do this" conversations happen constantly on job sites. Establish a clear rule with your field supervision:

**No work gets done on a verbal request unless it's clearly within the original scope. Any new or additional work gets a call to the office first.**

This is not bureaucracy. It is financial survival.

## The RFI and Change Order Process

### Request for Information (RFI)

An RFI is a formal written question submitted to the architect or GC asking for clarification on a drawing, spec, or coordination issue. RFIs are your first line of defense when scope is unclear.

If a drawing is ambiguous about whether a conduit stub-up is in your scope, submit an RFI asking for clarification. The response becomes part of the project record. If the clarification adds work, the RFI response is the basis for a change order.

**Key RFI practices:**
- Submit RFIs in writing, through the GC's designated process (email, project management software, formal RFI form)
- Number your RFIs sequentially
- State the issue clearly and specifically
- Request a response by a specific date
- Keep records of all RFIs and responses

### Change Order Requests (COR)

When additional work is requested or directed — verbally or in writing — submit a Change Order Request immediately. Do not wait until the end of the job. Do not do the work and hope to get paid later. The sequence should be:

1. Extra work is requested or identified
2. You stop and price the extra
3. You submit a written Change Order Request with description, labor hours, material cost, and total price
4. You get written authorization before proceeding (in most cases)
5. Work is performed
6. Change order is executed (signed by GC) and added to contract value

### Pricing Change Orders Correctly

Change order pricing is different from bid pricing. You are not competing for change order work — you are the incumbent, and the GC cannot easily find someone else to do the extra while your crew is on site. Price change orders to cover:
- Direct labor (fully burdened, with any applicable multipliers)
- Direct material
- Equipment rental directly attributable to the extra
- **Overhead and profit on change order work:** 10–20% is standard and appropriate. Do not price change orders at cost.
- **Impact costs:** If the extra work disrupts the sequence or productivity of your base-scope work, price that disruption separately. A two-hour extra that requires you to resequence a floor of work may have $500 in direct cost and $1,500 in impact cost.

## How to Say "That's an Extra" Without Blowing Up the Relationship

Many electricians — especially field supervisors — avoid the change order conversation because it feels confrontational. They absorb the work to "keep the peace." This is understandable. It is also wrong.

The way to protect your relationship with a GC while enforcing your contract is to be **professional, fast, and consistent**.

**The script:**
When a superintendent asks for something new, train your foreman to respond:
> "That sounds straightforward. Let me call the office and get you a number. We'll have a change order to you by end of day."

This response:
- Does not say "no"
- Does not start an argument
- Acknowledges the request professionally
- Sets a specific, fast timeline for a price
- Positions the change order as the normal, expected process

The GC superintendent who gets a change order within 24 hours of a request usually signs it. The superintendent who gets an email three weeks later with a lump-sum number at the end of the job does not.

Speed and documentation are your best tools for getting paid on extras.

## The Pre-Construction Scope Meeting

One of the most effective tools for preventing scope creep is the **pre-construction scope meeting** — a formal meeting between your PM/estimator and the GC's project manager before work begins.

The agenda:
1. Walk through your **scope of work inclusions and exclusions** as written in your proposal
2. Identify every ambiguity in the drawings or specifications that could become a dispute
3. Get written confirmation of how those ambiguities are resolved
4. Establish the **change order process**: who authorizes extras, how long for approval, what format
5. Set expectations: no verbal direction will result in uninvoiced work

Many GC PMs will push back on this meeting as "not necessary." Request it anyway. A 90-minute meeting before the first truck shows up can prevent 40 hours of dispute resolution at the end of the job.

## Protecting Against Backcharges from Other Trades

Scope creep runs in both directions. Other trades may damage your work, create conflicts that require your rework, or fail to coordinate in ways that cost you time. GCs may then try to issue backcharges against you for the cost of resolving these issues.

Protect yourself:
- **Document existing conditions** at mobilization (photos, written notice to GC)
- **Submit written notification immediately** when another trade damages your work or creates a conflict
- **Require GC-directed solutions** in writing: "At your direction, we relocated the conduit run on the second floor due to a structural conflict created by [other trade]. This work is a change to the contract."
- **Do not absorb other trades' problems.** If the HVAC contractor moved a duct and your conduit run needs to move as a result, that is a change order — not a warranty call on your original work.

## Template: Scope of Work Exclusions List

Every proposal you send should include a specific list of **exclusions** — work that is NOT included in your price. This is your clearest protection against scope creep before it starts.

**Standard Electrical Exclusions (adapt to each project):**

- Fire alarm systems and devices (by specialty contractor unless specifically included)
- Nurse call, security, or access control systems
- Audio/visual, structured cabling, and low-voltage systems (unless noted)
- Switchgear, transformer, or generator start-up and commissioning (unless included)
- Concrete cutting, core drilling, or patching (unless included)
- Underground boring or directional drilling
- Asbestos or hazardous material removal
- Temporary power (unless included)
- Arc flash labeling and coordination study
- LEED documentation (unless included)
- Work shown on Addendum [#] issued after bid date (unless included)
- Items shown on RFI responses after bid date (unless included)

A proposal with a clear exclusions list is a contract document. The GC who signs it has been given notice of what is and is not in the price.

Scope creep is not an accident. It is a predictable pattern in every commercial construction project. The question is not whether you will face it — you will, on every significant job. The question is whether you have the systems, the discipline, and the field culture to identify it, price it, and get paid for it.

The contractors who build wealth in this industry are the ones who execute the base scope at a fair margin and get paid for every dollar of extra work. Not because they are aggressive or difficult — but because they are organized, fast, and professional.

Document everything. Bill for everything. Apologize for nothing.
