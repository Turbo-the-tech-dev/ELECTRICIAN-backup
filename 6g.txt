welcome to another video in our security Command Center Series today we're delving into a vital component security health analytics security health analytics is an integral part
00:15
of security Command Center offering automatic detection of common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across numerous Google cloud services including compute engine cloud storage Cloud SQL Cloud DNS and
00:28
more security health analytics is enabled by default with the activation of either the standard or premium tiers of the security Command Center however access and modification
00:40
of configurations require specific roles such as the security Center admin editor role in Cloud IM setting up the correct role for security health analytics in the security
00:54
Command Center is a straightforward task first access the identity and access management I am by clicking on the navigation menu and selecting I am an admin
01:08
this displays the IM page where a list of various principles including users and service accounts is displayed for this demonstration we'll be assigning permissions to an existing
01:19
principal we've chosen demo user 2@gmail.com for this purpose on the IM page locate this principle in the list then click the pencil icon on to the
01:30
right of their name this opens the edit access page here we find the option to add another role clicking on it brings up a drop- down box
01:39
making it easy to select the role needed there's also a handy filter feature to quickly find the specific role you're looking for in this case we'll
01:48
find the security Center admin role begin typing security Center admin in the filter box and select it from the filtered results finally click save to assign this
01:59
Ro to the principal with these steps completed we've successfully granted the necessary permissions to the user for managing security health analytics in the security Command Center
02:10
this role is vital as it enables viewing and configuration the security settings in analytics which are essential for maintaining the security posture of your Cloud environment with
02:24
the appropriate permissions secured we can head back to the security Command Center to manage security health analytics the interface here allows for service management at both
02:33
project and folder levels offering the flexibility to tailor the service to specific areas within the cloud ecosystem even though security health analytics is typically enabled by default
02:45
there are times when you may need to manually activate or deactivate it for certain folders or projects this is a straightforward process within the security Command
02:56
Center interface to manually enable or disable security health Analytics first click on overview in the navigation menu of the security Command Center to ensure you're on the
03:06
main dashboard next click the settings button in the upper right corner the services are displayed in card format locate the security health analytics card and select
03:19
manage settings the service enablement page is displayed on this page identify the specific resource for which you want to enable security health analytics it could be an
03:29
entire or organization a particular folder or a specific project under the security health analytics column click the dropd down list for the resource chosen select enable
03:40
from this list security health analytics then becomes active for the chosen area in the security Command Center ready to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities note that it
03:52
may take up to 12 hours for the initial scan to complete after this initial scan the system will regularly scan the resource twice a day ensuring
04:02
continuous monitoring and Protection security health analytics employs a range of detectors each designed to pinpoint specific types of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within your Cloud ecosystem note that
04:17
detectors are referred to as modules in security command center with a comprehensive Suite of built-in detectors security health analytics systematically scans for a variety of security
04:29
concerns s covering an extensive array of categories and types of resources each one is aligned with a different category of findings including API Keys compute images containers
04:40
firewall rules and many more all to safeguard your Cloud environment from potential risks for a more extensive list of categories and types of resources refer to
04:50
the security health analytics documentation it's important to note that not every detector is automatically active to activate or deactivate specific detectors click on the modules tab to
05:02
find the module in question then within the status column use the drop- down box to choose either enable or disable as needed periodically you will want
05:15
to tailor Security checks to your organization's specific needs to do this you need to create a custom detector or module in this segment we'll dive into the
05:25
process of creating a custom module within the security health analytics of the security command center before we begin let's ensure we have everything in place it's
05:34
important to note that creating custom modules is a feature exclusive to the premium tier of the security Command Center if you haven't already upgraded this will be
05:44
a necessary step additionally confirm that the security Command Center API is activated as it's essential for this process to work smoothly the security Command Center API
05:54
provides programmatic access to the functionality and data of the security Command Center will quick quickly walk through how to activate this API click on the navigation menu
06:04
from the drop-down list find and click on apis and services then library in the API Library type security Command Center API into the search bar once
06:17
you found the security Command Center API in the list click on it you'll be taken to the API page where you can read more about what the
06:27
API offers to enable it click on the enable button after clicking enable wait for the process to complete you'll be redirected to the security Command Center
06:36
API overview page where it should now show that the API is enabled now that the API is enabled return to the security Command Center by clicking on
06:46
the navigation menu again and selecting security settings on the security health analytics C click the manage settings button then the modules tab next to proceed with
07:03
creating custom modules in security health analytics click create module a wizard will guide you through setting up your custom module Begin by giving it a name like
07:15
demo module number one next select a resource type from the drop-down menu for this example let's choose Cloud KMS crypto key as our resource The crucial
07:27
part is defining the detection logic with a cell common expression language expression this logic helps the system evaluate properties of the objects to spot misconfigurations and vulnerabilities
07:40
for instance create a cell expression to detect if a crypto key hasn't been recycled within a specific period there are many cell examples available online for
07:51
reference once you've input your cell expression click next Now define the severity of the findings from opt options ranging from critical to low let's set ours to
08:04
medium also add a detailed description of what you're finding is designed to detect an important aspect of custom modules is remediation steps detail the steps necessary
08:16
to correct the detected issue after adding this proceed to the next stage here you can choose to enable or disable your custom module let's keep it enabled
08:28
for now you you also have the option to test your module using a yaml file this file is crucial for ensuring your module functions as intended
08:36
upload a sample yaml file for a test run if you need guidance on creating this file refer to the learn more about generating asset data link after
08:45
testing click to create your module once created it will appear in the list of modules under the security health analytics page with our custom module now
08:56
set up we've taken a significant step step in enhancing our Cloud environment security remember these customizations allow us to focus on what's most crucial for our organization's
09:06
unique security requirements so far we have explored how security health analytics in the security Command Center helps detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within our Cloud ecosystem once
09:22
these vulnerabilities are identified they're listed in the security Command Center where we can view them in various ways let's delve into how you can navigate and interpret
09:32
these findings in the navigation panel on the left select vulnerabilities this brings up a dashboard displaying numerous vulnerabilities organized across multiple columns these columns include the
09:45
status of the vulnerability indicating its severity and the last detection time as well as various categories of vulnerabilities such as open firewall open SSH port and public
09:56
IP addresses another key element in this display is the module IDs which correspond to the detectors in security health analytics you'll also notice recommendations alongside each
10:08
vulnerability offering guidance for remediation active findings are also listed showing the count of detected vulnerabilities another important feature is the standards column which aligns each vulnerability with
10:22
regulatory standards like PCI CIS or nist this alignment is crucial for maintain aing compliance within your organization with potentially numerous vulnerabilities filtering them becomes essential click
10:38
on the vulnerability space to access a dropdown for filtering options for instance by selecting categories you can filter for specific types such as firewalls select open firewalls
10:50
to narrow down the search for more detailed information on a particular vulnerability click on its category this action opens a new window the findings window where
11:01
you can fine-tune your search for vulnerabilities threats and misconfigurations if you're specifically interested in findings from security health analytics use the quick filters at the bottom to
11:12
select the source display name filtering the display to only show relevant findings in an upcoming video we'll dive deeper into optimizing the use of the findings
11:23
page for now let's focus on an individual finding click on a category like open firewall to view Det detailed information you'll see an AI generated summary offering
11:33
real-time analysis and Remediation suggestions further in the findings details you'll find descriptions the state of the finding creation time which is useful for Audits and the
11:45
