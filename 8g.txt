welcome in this video we'll discuss container threat detection containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an applications code with all the files and
00:13
libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure in today's cyber security landscape it's imperative to understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with containerization
00:23
container threat detection is a critical component in identifying and addressing such risks container threat detection is a powerful security feature that is included in
00:35
the security Command Center premium tier it provides continuous and comprehensive scanning of the node images of container optimized OS ensuring that any potential security
00:44
threats are identified and addressed in a timely manner the service utilizes Advanced algorithms to quickly detect any runtime attacks by analyzing changes and remote
00:55
access attempts in addition it provides alerts to users of common container attacks through through the security Command Center and Cloud logging the container threat
01:04
detection feature is designed to detect and identify a wide range of threats including suspicious files and harmful plain text bash scripts the service employs
01:13
natural language processing NLP techniques to analyze and identify potentially harmful scripts making it an extremely effective tool for securing container environments overall the container threat
01:27
detection feature is an essential component of any container security strategy it provides realtime threat detection ensuring that any potential threats are addressed before they
01:38
can cause damage to the system with its Advanced capabilities and comprehensive scanning container threat detection is a musthave for organizations that rely on container
01:46
technology to support their business operations so how exactly does container threat detection work for starters container threat detection uses what is known as detection
02:00
instrumentation this sophisticated technology collects detailed activity from the guest Colonel and any executed bash scripts when container threat detection detects an event the event
02:10
information along with identifiers for the container is sent via a user mode Damon set to a specialized Detector service for in-depth analysis note that
02:21
although the Damon set is designed to be diligent it operates on a best effort basis this means that if kubernetes or the container runtime
02:29
is delayed in delivering container information that data might not be included in the reported findings the core of the system is the Detector service
02:38
it scrutinizes the events to decide whether something is just an anomaly or a potential security incident one of the standout features of the container threat
02:48
detection technology is the use of natural language processing to evaluate the contents of bash scripts determining if they're just regular scripts or something malicious
02:57
if an incident is detected the service records it as a finding within the security Command Center you can check out the details of any
03:05
findings directly in the security command center dashboard where you can also conduct further investigations keep in mind what you can see and do with
03:14
these findings depends on the access roles you've been granted container threat detection includes a set of detectors each with specific roles and identifying potential
03:24
security breaches the added binary executed detector is crucial in spotting any binary that is executed but wasn't part of the original container image such
03:34
An Occurrence could indicate unauthorized access or control so it's vital for early threat detection the added Library loaded detector similar to the binary detector
03:44
alerts if a library that was not in the original container image gets loaded it's another key indicator of possible unauthorized code execution within the
03:54
container the malicious script executed detector employs Advanced natural language processing to analyze executed bash scripts it's designed to identify scripts that could be harmful helping
04:05
catch more sophisticated attacks the malicious URL observe detector checks the argument list of running processes against a list of unsafe web resources maintained by
04:16
the Google safe browsing service lastly the reverse shell detector is particularly important it identifies when a process starts with its input or output streams
04:28
redirected to a remote connected socket this can be a sign of an attacker seeking to control the workload remotely a common tactic in advanced
04:35
cyber attacks let's take a look at the system when you activate security Command Center premium container threat detection is enabled by default unless you
04:47
choose to disable it during the activation process if you need to enable or disable container threat detection for your organization or project you can
04:56
do so on the security Command Center settings page to access the settings page click the navigation menu in the top left corner then select
05:04
security from the list of services next click the settings icon that resembles a gear or tools at the top right of the screen cards
05:19
representing each service appear locate the container threat detection card and select manage settings the service enablement page appears on this page identify the specific resource
05:31
on which to enable the container threat detection threat detection can be enabled or disabled for a particular folder or a specific project in the
05:42
service enablement section click the drop- down box for the chosen resource here you may enable or disable the detection this option ensures that container
05:51
threat detection becomes active for the chosen folder or project now we're ready to identify container threats with container threat detection enabled we'll verify that
06:06
it's functioning correctly within the security Command Center by intentionally triggering detectors and checking for findings to ensure the system's security measures are active and
06:15
effective before diving in there's a crucial prerequisite to effectively detect potential threats to your containers it's essential that your clusters are running on a
06:26
supported version of Google kubernetes engine for detailed information on using a supported gke version please refer to the relevant documentation so let's set up
06:36
our testing environment we'll be using the Google Cloud console and Cloud shell for this exercise from the Google console select the project that contains
06:46
the container you intend to use for this test next click the icon for activate Cloud shell in the upper right corner in the cloud shell
06:57
we'll set up the environment enironment variables we'll start with the environment variable for the Zone our cluster is in type export Zone equals followed
07:07
by the name of the Zone next set the variable for the project your container is in with export project equals followed by project ID
07:18
and finally Define your cluster name with export cluster underscore name equals followed by the cluster name with these variables set you're now ready to
07:31
begin testing the container threat detection detectors now we will trigger an added binary executed finding in the container threat detection this process involves adding
07:44
and executing a binary in your container which is a critical test to ensure your security measures are effectively detecting unexpected changes in your environment
07:53
we'll start by understanding the rationale behind this test we'll deploy the latest auntu 8 18.04 image copy binaries to a different location in the
08:03
container and then execute it the execution of this binary will be flagged as unexpected because this copy wasn't part of the original container image
08:13
first let's make sure we have access to the cluster control plane by entering the following command in Cloud shell Now The crucial part dropping and
08:27
executing the binary to do this paste the command at the prompt this command sets a unique tag based on the current date and time
08:36
it then deploys a container with the Ubuntu 18.04 image copies binaries to tag and executes it executing this test should generate an added binary
08:46
executed finding next we'll check for this finding in the security Command Center in this section we'll focus on review viewing container threat detection findings
09:01
in the security Command Center this is a vital step in monitoring and responding to security issues within your Google Cloud environment let's dive into
09:10
the steps needed to effectively use this feature navigate to the security Command Center findings page in the Google Cloud console confirm you are viewing
09:21
your Google Cloud project or organization this ensures you're viewing the findings relevant to your specific environment next in the quick filter section look for
09:30
the source display name subsection here select container threat detection this filter will narrow down the findings to those specifically detected by the container threat
09:42
detection service to delve into the details of a specific finding click on the finding name listed under the category column this action will expand the
09:51
finding details pane providing you with a wealth of information organized into various sections you will see sections like what was detected which includes information
10:00
about the security issue that was detected complete with an AI generated summary of the issue the affected resource section will give you details about
10:10
where the issue was detected if your team has added any security marks to the finding they will be under the security marks section furthermore
10:19
the detection service section provides information about the security Command Center service that detected the issue such as container threat detection and detail about the finding
10:30
itself finally for a comprehensive view of the finding in a structured format you can click on the Json tab this tab will display the
10:39
complete Json structuring of the finding which can be particularly useful for technical analysis and recordkeeping so reviewing container threat detection findings in the security
10:49
Command Center is a crucial step in maintaining the security Integrity of your Google Cloud environment by following these steps you can effectively monitor analyze
10:59
and respond to security issues detected within your infrastructure thanks for watching this training on Google's container threat detection we'll see you in the next video
