## Repository Management

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive repository names
- Maintain clear README files
- Document code purpose and usage
- Follow consistent branching strategies
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backup procedures

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens as separators
- Include project context in names
- Examples: `electrical-calculator-app`, `load-analysis-tool`
- Avoid special characters in names
- Keep names concise but descriptive

## Version Control Strategies

### Git Workflows
- Feature branch workflow
- Gitflow methodology
- Forking workflow
- Centralized workflow
- Choose based on team size and project complexity

### Branch Management
- Use descriptive branch names
- Keep branches focused on specific features
- Regularly sync with main branch
- Delete obsolete branches
- Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`

### Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit formats
- Keep commits focused on single changes
- Include issue references when applicable
- Use present tense in commit messages

## Code Quality Standards

### Code Review Process
- Implement peer review procedures
- Check for code standards compliance
- Verify functionality and safety
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Test code in appropriate environments

### Testing Requirements
- Include unit tests for critical functions
- Test electrical calculations for accuracy
- Verify safety-related code thoroughly
- Include integration tests for complex systems
- Maintain high test coverage percentages

## Security Considerations

### Repository Security
