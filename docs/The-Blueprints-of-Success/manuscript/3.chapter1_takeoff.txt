# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 1: The Takeoff — Reading the Prints Like Money

---

Before a single wire gets pulled, before a panel gets set, before a crew shows up on a Monday morning, someone sat down with a set of drawings and built the estimate from scratch. That process is called the **takeoff**. It is the foundation of everything that follows.

Get the takeoff right, and every other number in your estimate has a chance to be right. Get it wrong — miss a panel, undercount the receptacles, forget to scale the conduit runs in the mechanical room — and no amount of sharp labor pricing or overhead management will save you. You are building a house on sand.

This chapter teaches you how to build it on concrete.

## What Is a Takeoff?

A takeoff is the systematic process of **quantifying every piece of electrical work** shown on a set of construction drawings. The name comes from the old practice of "taking off" quantities from the blueprints — physically marking and counting each item as you pulled it from the sheet.

The output of a takeoff is a complete bill of quantities: every outlet, every fixture, every circuit, every foot of conduit, every panel, every motor connection, every piece of gear — counted, measured, and organized by type and location.

This quantity list is the raw material your estimate is built from. Every labor hour, every material cost, every rental item, every subcontractor scope starts here.

## Setting Up Your Digital Workspace

Most commercial electrical work today is bid from digital prints. PDFs have largely replaced paper rolls, and digital takeoff tools have largely replaced scale rulers and colored pencils. But the fundamentals are the same: you are working through a drawing set page by page, item by item.

### Organizing the Drawing Set

Before you count a single symbol, organize the drawing set:

1. **Download and sort all sheets** — E (Electrical), M (Mechanical), P (Plumbing), A (Architectural), S (Structural). You will need all of them at some point.
2. **Identify the electrical sheets specifically:**
   - E0.x — Electrical general notes, schedules, legends
   - E1.x — Site/civil electrical (site lighting, underground)
   - E2.x — Power plans (receptacles, equipment connections)
   - E3.x — Lighting plans
   - E4.x — Special systems (fire alarm, data, security)
   - E5.x — One-line diagrams and panel schedules
3. **Read the legend first.** Every project has a symbol legend. Do not assume you know what a symbol means. Read it.
4. **Read the Division 26 specification section.** The specs describe installation requirements, acceptable materials, and coordination responsibilities that are not shown on the drawings. Many estimators skip this. They get surprised in the field.

### Digital Tools

- **Bluebeam Revu** — Industry standard PDF markup and measurement tool. Allows you to count symbols with auto-count, measure distances, and organize quantities by color/layer.
- **PlanGrid / Autodesk Construction Cloud** — Cloud-based plan management with markup tools.
- **On-Screen Takeoff (OST)** — Dedicated takeoff software for electrical and mechanical.
- **Plain Adobe Acrobat** — If nothing else is available, you can still measure distances and mark items manually.

Whatever tool you use, establish a **color-coding system** and stick to it. Every estimator on your team should mark the same item type the same color. This prevents double-counting and makes QC review possible.

## Reading the Drawings: What You're Looking For

### The Panel Schedule

Start here, not with the floor plans. The panel schedule tells you what is being fed, how many circuits exist, and the size of the overcurrent protection. It is a summary of the job.

From the panel schedule, extract:
- Number and size of panels (MLO vs. main breaker, bus ampacity)
- Circuit count by panel
- Any GFCI, AFCI, or specialty breaker requirements
- Feed conductors for each panel (size, quantity, conduit)

Cross-reference the panel schedule against the one-line diagram. Discrepancies are common and must be noted before bid.

### Symbol Counting on Floor Plans

Work through each floor plan systematically. Develop a routine — most estimators work from top-left to bottom-right, one system at a time:

1. **Receptacles first** (duplex, GFCI, dedicated, 20A, 30A, specialty)
2. **Switches and dimmers**
3. **Lighting fixtures** (cross-reference the lighting fixture schedule)
4. **Data/voice/low voltage devices** (even if not in your scope, locate them for conduit routing)
5. **Equipment connections** (motors, HVAC units, kitchen equipment)
6. **Exit/emergency lighting**
7. **Special systems devices** (smoke detectors, pull stations, cameras — check scope)

Mark each item as you count it. Never count an unmarked drawing. You will lose track.

### Measuring Conduit Runs

Conduit runs are where most takeoff errors occur. Estimators tend to underestimate conduit for two reasons: (1) they forget vertical drops and risers, and (2) they scale horizontal runs without adding 20–30% for bends, offsets, and routing around obstructions.

**Horizontal runs:** Measure center-line of conduit path on the floor plan. Use your digital tool's measurement function and calibrate the scale on each sheet — never assume all sheets are the same scale.

**Vertical runs:** These are almost never shown directly on plan views. You need to look at wall sections, details, and the riser diagram. Add riser heights based on floor-to-floor dimensions from the architectural drawings.

**Add a stub-up/stub-down factor:** For every home run and every equipment connection, add the vertical distance from the ceiling to the device/panel/equipment. These small runs add up significantly on large jobs.

**Rule of thumb:** After measuring all conduit, add 10–15% for waste, bends, coupling, and minor routing adjustments. On congested jobs (mechanical rooms, above existing ceilings), increase that to 20–25%.

## Common Takeoff Mistakes That Cost Thousands

**1. Missing the reflected ceiling plan.**
Lighting fixtures are shown on the reflected ceiling plan (RCP), not always on the electrical plan. If there are two separate sheets and you only count one, you are missing fixtures.

**2. Ignoring addenda.**
Between bid release and bid day, the architect may issue multiple addenda revising the drawings. Each addendum must be incorporated into your takeoff. Missing Addendum #3 that added 15 home runs to the fourth floor is a five-figure error.

**3. Assuming "by others."**
When a drawing note says "coordinate with mechanical contractor," clarify before bid whether conduit rough-in is in your scope. GCs will assume it is if you don't address it.

**4. Forgetting underground and site work.**
Exterior site electrical — underground feeders, site lighting, transformer pads, manholes — is often on a separate sheet that gets missed in the rush to price the building.

**5. Not reading the spec sections for special systems.**
If you are responsible for fire alarm rough-in but not the fire alarm devices and panels (which are by a specialty sub), the spec section should say so. If you don't read it, you may include or exclude incorrectly.

**6. Miscounting three-phase circuits.**
A three-phase circuit needs three conductors plus a neutral plus a ground in a single conduit. If you count "circuits" without thinking about conductor count, your wire takeoff will be significantly short.

## Building Your Takeoff Checklist

Every estimating department should have a standard takeoff checklist. Here is a starting framework:

**Before you start:**
- [ ] Full drawing set downloaded and organized
- [ ] All addenda incorporated
- [ ] Legend and symbol schedule reviewed
- [ ] Division 26 spec section read
- [ ] Drawing scale verified on each sheet

**Systems to count:**
- [ ] Service entrance and main gear
- [ ] Distribution panels (complete panel schedule review)
- [ ] All feeders and home runs
- [ ] Branch circuit wiring (by panel, by floor)
- [ ] Lighting fixtures (by type, cross-ref fixture schedule)
- [ ] Power receptacles (by type)
- [ ] Equipment connections (motors, HVAC, kitchen)
- [ ] Exit and emergency lighting
- [ ] Site electrical (underground, site lighting, outdoor equipment)
- [ ] Temporary power (if in scope)
- [ ] Special systems rough-in (confirm scope)

**After the count:**
- [ ] Panel schedule circuitry cross-referenced to floor plans
- [ ] Conduit quantities reviewed for vertical add
- [ ] Wire quantities calculated from conduit (include pull string)
- [ ] Scope gaps / clarifications documented
- [ ] Takeoff reviewed by second set of eyes (if possible)

## A Note on Speed vs. Accuracy

There is constant pressure in the bidding world to turn estimates quickly. GCs often release drawings with 10-day or 14-day bid windows. On large, complex projects, that is barely enough time to do a thorough job.

Do not sacrifice accuracy for speed. A rushed takeoff that misses 10% of the work will cost you more than the bid you won't get if you submit two days late. Most GCs will accept a call asking for a 48-hour extension if you ask professionally before the deadline.

Speed comes with practice. The estimator who has done 50 hospital takeoffs will move faster than the one doing their second. Build the habit of accuracy first. Speed follows.

The takeoff is not glamorous work. It is deliberate, methodical, and sometimes tedious. It is also the most important thing you will do for any project. Everything downstream — the labor, the material, the overhead, the proposal — is a calculation applied to the quantities you produced right here.

Count right. Mark everything. Trust your checklist.
