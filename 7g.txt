welcome to another video in the security Command Center series event threat detection this service is a pivotal feature in the security Command Center
00:11
premium tier this Advanced tool is designed to Monitor and detect potential threats to your organization acting as a Vigilant Security mechanism event threat
00:23
detection operates by continuously scrutinizing log files across your entire organization or specific projects when activated at the organization level it immediately begins collecting
00:33
and analyzing logs from projects as they are generated by constantly monitoring these logs it proactively searches for and identifies unusual or suspicious Behavior
00:42
patterns upon detecting a Potential Threat event threat detection generates an alert and creates a finding within the security Command Center although event threat
00:52
detection is automatically enabled with the premium tier viewing and configuring requires appropriate permissions in Cloud identity and access management or Cloud am event
01:06
threat detection is automatically activated with a premium tier but there may be occasions where you need to disable or enable this service for
01:14
specific folders or projects to do this navigate to the security Command Center click settings locate the card for event threat detection and click the
01:28
manage settings button in the service enable mment section you'll be presented with your organizational structure expand the tree to view all the folders
01:37
and embedded projects select the object you wish to modify we'll choose the app development project in the event threat detection column you'll find
01:45
a dropdown box where you can enable or disable the service for that specific project we will select enable now event threat detection is
01:54
enabled for the app development project event threat detection operates through the use of rules rules Define the type of threats that event threat
02:07
detection detects and the types of logs that must be enabled for detectors to work let's take a closer look at how these rules
02:13
function for instance consider the scenario of detecting a Brute Force SSH attack this kind of attack exploits weak or default passwords that are
02:24
commonly used on servers to identify such an attack using event threat detection it's essential to first enable the authentication log commonly referred to
02:33
as the O log enabling this log allows the detection system to Monitor and identify any successful Brute Force attempts on SSH hosts please consult
02:44
the Google Cloud logging documentation for detailed instructions on how to enable various logging apis remember the effectiveness of the event threat detection heavily
02:53
relies on the appropriate configuration of these rules and logs by ensuring that the correct logs are enabled and monitored you significantly enhance the
03:03
security mechanism's ability to detect and alert potential threats to your Cloud environment to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various rules available within
03:12
event threat detection refer to the security Command Center documentation event threat detection employs an array of built-in detectors also called modules to pinpoint
03:26
various threats modifying these detectors can only be done at the organization level to modify detectors start by going to the security Command Center
03:36
then clicking settings from the cards select event threat detection then manage settings the service enablement page displays click the moduls tab to view
03:46
the list of detectors available each detector listed here offers the choice to enable or disable it next we'll discuss how to create custom
03:58
modules to tailor threat detection further now that we've reviewed built-in modules it's time to look into creating a custom module which will allow for
04:12
even more targeted threat detection within the security Command Center to get started click create module to open a wizard that facilitates the customization
04:20
of modules for event threat detection the initial step involves selecting a module template these templates are pre-existing detectors that you can tailor to
04:31
your specific needs for our demonstration we'll use the compute engine regions module this module allows customization of specific regions for your threat detections
04:39
click select to proceed and then give your module a name we'll name ours demo one next you have the option to specify the regions
04:50
for scanning you can either copy and paste a list of regions or use the drop- down list to select your preferred region after
05:01
making your selection click next to proceed to the enter finding details section on this page you'll have an opportunity to define the severity
05:11
of the findings which ranges from critical to low we'll set ours to medium for this example it's also important to enter a detailed
05:18
description of the module a clear and concise description is vital for other administrators who may review this information and for clarity when findings are
05:27
reported however for simp licity for this demo we will just enter demo Additionally you have the option to Define steps for remediation providing
05:37
step-by-step instructions for addressing potential threats detected by this module is crucial this guidance is invaluable for administrator's task with remediating any issues identified
05:49
by the module after entering the remediation steps click the create button to finalize your custom module and that's it you've now successfully created
05:59
a custom module in the event threat detection of the security Command Center this module will enhance your ability to detect specific threats tailor
06:08
to your organization's unique requirements improving your overall security posture now that we have reviewed the different detectors available with event threat detection let's
06:23
intentionally trigger an identity and access management or IAM anomalous Grant detector and observe the general at findings an anomalous Grant finding is triggered
06:32
when an I am member is created outside of the organization's domain performing this step is essential for understanding how to monitor and manage
06:41
potential security threats in your Google Cloud environment let's begin by setting the stage for our test we'll initiate the process by using a test
06:49
user with a Gmail account employing a Gmail account for this test should ideally trigger the anomalous Grant we're aiming to detect the first
06:59
step involves navigating to the IAM and admin section from the Google Cloud's navigation pane select IAM and admin this is where we'll introduce
07:08
the test user into the scenario in the list of principles we locate the fictional user secc user1 1223 gmail.com and click the pencil
07:19
icon to edit the next crucial step is to assign a role to this user click add another role in the drop-down list choose basic
07:28
then owner assigning such a highlevel role to a Gmail account is unusual and should set off our detector clicking save will apply this
07:37
change now on to the next part verifying the detection return to the security Command Center by clicking on security in the navigation menu
07:49
from here click findings to pinpoint recent activity the time range can be adjusted to filter the results to display recent triggers for this
07:57
demo the trigger we're looking for the assistant IAM anomalous Grant finding is right here once located click on it to open the detail page
08:07
here on the detail page we're provided with an AI generated summary which gives us a full breakdown of the activity helping us to
08:15
understand the exact nature of the threat and its potential impact so there you have it a firsthand look at the power and precision
08:23
of event threat detection within the Google Cloud security Command Center this test not only shows the systems Effectiveness in real time but also
08:31
gives us crucial insights into how to better protect our Cloud environment against unconventional access patterns or security breaches finally security Command Center provides
08:46
multiple ways to Monitor and analyze threats detected by the event threat detection system one option is to Simply navigate to the security Command
08:55
Center and select threats from the left panel this action opens opens the threats dashboard an intuitive interface designed for a detailed examination of
09:04
potential and identified threats within the dashboard users will find that threats are methodically categorized for ease of analysis these categories range in severity
09:14
levels spanning from critical to low enabling users to prioritize their response efforts based on the urgency of each threat additionally threats are systematically organized
09:25
by categories offering a clear and concise overview of the nature and type of each detected threat for instance in our recent testing one
09:34
notable category highlighted was the persistance IAM anomalous Grant this kind of categorization not only helps in quick identification of specific threats but also
09:45
AIDS in understanding their context and potential impact moreover the security Command Center allows for searching threats by projects this feature is particularly useful
09:57
for organizations managing multiple projects as it enables security administrators to isolate and focus on threats relevant to specific project environments by selecting any of
10:06
these categories or Project Specific threats users are directed to the finding screen here they can delve deeper into each finding accessing detailed information
10:16
and insights this level of detail is invaluable for thorough threat assessment and for formulating informed and effective security strategies overall the security command
10:26
Center's approach to threat management exemplifies blend of comprehensive data organization and userfriendly navigation ensuring that security teams are well equipped to safeguard their
10:37
digital assets effectively this concludes our review of the event threat detection for security Command Center thank you and see you in the next video
