# THE BLUEPRINTS OF SUCCESS
## Chapter 6: Digital Estimating — Software, Speed, and Accuracy

---

In 1985, a commercial electrical estimator sat at a drafting table with a scale ruler, a pad of columnar paper, and a pricing catalog. He counted symbols with a pencil and a highlighter, wrote quantities in columns by hand, looked up material prices from a printed book that was six months out of date, and calculated extensions on a 10-key adding machine. It took days. When he was done, it took more days to type the proposal.

Today, that same estimate — same drawings, same scope, same complexity — takes 4–8 hours on a well-configured digital platform with current pricing databases. It is more accurate, more consistent, and far easier to review.

This chapter is about understanding modern estimating software: what it does well, what it does poorly, how to choose the right tool, and — most importantly — why the technology does not replace the estimator.

## The Evolution: Pen-and-Paper to Digital

### The Old Way (and Why It's Still Taught)

Manual estimating is not dead. Many small contractors still estimate on spreadsheets or paper, and there is genuine value in learning the manual method first. When you build an estimate by hand, you understand every number. You see how material pricing works, how labor units accumulate, how overhead gets allocated. Nothing is hidden in a black box.

An estimator trained manually who moves to software is dangerous in the best sense — they can audit the software, spot errors, and understand why numbers look the way they do.

An estimator trained only on software who loses access to that software (company switches platforms, licensing lapses, system crash) is stuck. More critically: they may not fully understand what the software is doing, which means they may not catch when it is doing it wrong.

If you are new to estimating, consider doing your first 5–10 estimates manually — or at minimum, parallel-processing a manual estimate alongside a software estimate to understand the relationship between inputs and outputs.

### What Digital Estimating Actually Does

Estimating software does not estimate for you. It:
- Speeds up the **takeoff** (counting, measuring from digital prints)
- Automates **pricing lookups** (current material prices from distributor or database)
- Applies **assemblies** (pre-built sets of materials and labor for common tasks)
- Calculates **extensions** (quantity × unit cost × labor units)
- Generates **formatted reports** (bid tabs, proposal letters, job cost reports)
- Maintains **historical databases** (your previous jobs, your labor factors, your pricing)

The intelligence — the judgment about conditions, scope, risk, and strategy — still lives entirely with the estimator.

### Estimator360

**Best for:** Small contractors ($0–$5M revenue range) who want a cloud-based, accessible tool.

**Key features:**
- Web-based (no installation required)
- Simpler interface, lower learning curve
- Includes project management and scheduling features
- Subscription is typically lower cost than enterprise platforms

**Strengths:** Affordable, easy to start, good for one-person estimating operations.

**Weaknesses:** Less depth than Accubid or McCormick for complex commercial work. Less suited for large, multi-phase projects.

---

### Procore Estimating

**Key features:**
- Integrated into the Procore construction management platform
- Useful if you are already using Procore for project management
- Allows estimate-to-actual tracking within one system

**Strengths:** Seamless connection to project management, cost tracking, and billing.

**Weaknesses:** Estimating module is less specialized than dedicated electrical estimating software. Pricing database requires significant customization.

### Spreadsheet-Based Estimating (Excel / Google Sheets)

**When is it enough?**

For contractors under $1–2M in annual revenue, or for quick budgets and conceptual estimates, a well-designed spreadsheet can work effectively. Many experienced estimators maintain custom spreadsheets they have refined over years that function nearly as well as commercial software for their specific work mix.

**Advantages:**
- Zero software cost
- Fully customizable
- No vendor dependency
- Easy to share and modify

**Disadvantages:**
- No built-in takeoff integration
- Manual pricing updates required
- No assembly database
- Prone to formula errors if not carefully maintained
- Does not scale well to large, complex bids

If you are using spreadsheets, audit them regularly. A broken formula that goes undetected for months can introduce systemic errors across every estimate.

## Building Your Assemblies Database

The most valuable long-term asset in any estimating software is a well-maintained **assemblies database**. An assembly is a pre-built grouping of materials and labor for a common task.

Examples:
- "20A 120V circuit, EMT, 100 feet, #12 wire" = 100 ft EMT, 300 ft #12 THHN, fittings, wire nuts, boxes — with associated labor units
- "2x4 LED troffer, T-bar ceiling, with circuit" = fixture, mounting hardware, circuit wire, box, labor
- "200A 3-phase panel, surface, with feed" = panel, feeder wire and conduit, ground, labor

A good assembly database means you can count 47 LED troffers on a floor plan and instantly have a fully loaded cost — material and labor — for all 47, including the circuit wiring.

**Building your database:**
- Start with the software manufacturer's default assemblies
- Customize every assembly based on how your crews actually install that item
- Update labor units based on your historical performance data
- Update material pricing at least quarterly

An estimator who inherits a well-built assemblies database from a retiring colleague inherits years of accumulated knowledge. An estimator who builds their own database over time builds competitive advantage that no competitor can easily replicate.

## Garbage In, Garbage Out

The most dangerous thing about estimating software is that it produces results that look authoritative. A well-formatted bid summary with a total at the bottom feels certain. It carries a kind of credibility that a handwritten estimate on a legal pad does not.

But the software is only as good as its inputs. If your material prices are 18 months out of date, the software will calculate the wrong material cost with perfect accuracy. If your assemblies have incorrect labor units, the software will calculate the wrong labor cost in a beautifully formatted report.

**Audit checkpoints before every bid:**
- When were the material prices last updated? Are they current?
- Are the labor units in the assemblies you're using consistent with your actual field performance?
- Have you applied the right labor multipliers manually for this job's conditions? (Software typically does not auto-apply height, weather, or congestion factors)
- Is the overhead and profit percentage correct for the current market?
- Did you include job-specific costs (permits, lifts, temp power) that the software doesn't know about?

Software answers the question "how much is this if my assumptions are correct?" Your job is to make the assumptions correct.

## Training Your Team to Estimate Consistently

One of the hidden benefits of estimating software is **consistency**: when multiple estimators use the same assemblies, the same pricing, and the same process, their estimates are comparable and auditable in ways that individualized manual estimates are not.

Building a consistent estimating culture requires:
- **Standardized assemblies** that everyone uses and no one overrides without authorization
- **Defined processes** for takeoff, pricing updates, and bid review
- **Regular calibration sessions** where estimators review the same drawing set independently and compare results
- **Post-job feedback loops** where estimated vs. actual data feeds back into the assembly database

If your company has two estimators who would produce numbers 20% apart on the same job, you have a consistency problem. Software can help solve it — but only if both estimators are using it the same way.

---

The right software, properly configured, maintained, and used by an estimator who understands the underlying math, is a genuine competitive advantage. It allows you to bid more jobs, bid them faster, and produce more consistent, reviewable results than manual methods allow.

The wrong software — or the right software used incorrectly — is an expensive generator of wrong answers. Choose carefully, invest in training, and never stop asking why the number looks the way it does.
