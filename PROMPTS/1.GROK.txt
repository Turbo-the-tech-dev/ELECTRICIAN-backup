Based on the details you shared about your background—20 years of experience starting in business parks and high-end residential in areas like Torrance and Hermosa, then moving to large commercial projects like Westfield malls (e.g., Fox Hills and Topanga)—you've got a strong foundation that aligns well with a city electrician role. This kind of work often involves maintaining public facilities, troubleshooting systems in multi-building environments, and ensuring safety in high-traffic areas, which matches your commercial and residential expertise. Owning a Tesla and aspiring to work for Elon Musk is a great motivator—perhaps you can weave in your interest in EV charging infrastructure or sustainable energy systems if it comes up, as cities like Glendale are expanding those. For now, let's focus on nailing this phone interview to get you in the door; it could be a solid step toward bigger opportunities.

### Quick Prep Tips for Your Phone Interview
- **Set Up Your Space**: Find a quiet spot with good signal. Have your resume, notes on your experience, and the job details handy (I'll summarize the key ones below based on similar City of Glendale postings). Test your phone or video setup if it's virtual.
- **Research the Role**: City electrician jobs emphasize journey-level work in public buildings, like installing/repairing wiring, motors, HVAC controls, lighting in parking lots, and computerized systems (e.g., access controls). They value safety, codes (National and California Electrical Codes), and multi-facility experience—your mall and business park work is a perfect fit for that.
- **Highlight Your Strengths**: With 20 years, stress your progression from residential to large-scale commercial. Mention any leadership (e.g., leading teams on mall projects) or troubleshooting in high-stakes environments. If your GitHub repo includes things like electrical schematics, automation scripts (e.g., for smart systems or PLCs), or EV-related projects, reference it as a digital portfolio to show initiative—e.g., "I've documented some of my troubleshooting workflows and custom installations on GitHub to showcase efficient, code-compliant solutions."
- **Tie to the City**: Show enthusiasm for public service. Glendale's facilities include municipal buildings, parks, and infrastructure—frame your experience as preparing you to maintain safe, reliable systems for the community.
- **Common Structure**: Phone interviews for these roles often last 20-45 minutes. Expect a mix of behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about a time..."), technical ones on codes/safety, and why you want the job. Practice speaking clearly and concisely—aim for 1-2 minutes per answer.
- **Follow Up**: Send a thank-you email recapping a key point from the call and reiterating your interest.

### Sample Interview Questions with Tailored Answers
Here are common questions for electrician roles, especially public sector ones. I've suggested answers based on your experience—adapt them to sound natural. Practice aloud.

1. **Tell me about yourself and your experience as an electrician.**
   - *Why they ask*: To gauge fit and communication.
   - *Sample Answer*: "I've been in the electrical field for 20 years, starting with installations in business parks and high-end residential projects in Torrance and Hermosa Beach, where I handled everything from custom wiring to smart home systems. I then moved to larger commercial work, like the Westfield malls at Fox Hills and Topanga, troubleshooting high-voltage panels, lighting circuits, and HVAC controls under tight deadlines. This built my skills in multi-facility maintenance, similar to city buildings. I'm passionate about reliable, safe systems—owning a Tesla has even sparked my interest in EV infrastructure, which I'd love to apply here in Glendale to support community needs."

2. **Why do you want to work for the City of Glendale?**
   - *Why they ask*: To check motivation and cultural fit.
   - *Sample Answer*: "I'm drawn to public sector work because it lets me contribute to community safety and efficiency, building on my commercial experience in high-traffic environments like malls. Glendale's focus on maintaining facilities aligns with my background, and I'd enjoy the stability to support my family while pursuing interests in sustainable tech—like EV charging, inspired by innovators like Elon Musk. This role feels like a great fit to apply my 20 years toward meaningful public service."

3. **Describe a time you troubleshot a complex electrical issue.**
   - *Why they ask*: Behavioral; tests problem-solving.
   - *Sample Answer*: "At the Topanga Westfield mall, we had intermittent power failures in the lighting system affecting multiple stores. I used a circuit tracer and multimeter to isolate a faulty control panel relay, checked against blueprints, and replaced it while coordinating with the team to minimize downtime. We finished ahead of schedule, preventing revenue loss. This honed my ability to work safely under pressure, adhering to NEC codes."

4. **What safety protocols do you follow on the job?**
   - *Why they ask*: Safety is huge in public roles.
   - *Sample Answer*: "Safety is non-negotiable—I always start with lockout/tagout, wear PPE, and verify de-energization with a voltmeter. In my mall projects, I followed OSHA and California Electrical Code guidelines, conducting risk assessments for confined spaces or heights. I've never had an incident in 20 years, and I'm trained in arc flash and fall protection."

5. **Explain the difference between a circuit breaker and a fuse.**
   - *Why they ask*: Technical basics.
   - *Sample Answer*: "Both protect circuits from overloads, but a circuit breaker is resettable—it trips mechanically or magnetically and can be flipped back on after resolving the issue. A fuse melts internally and must be replaced. Breakers are more convenient for frequent use, like in city facilities where quick resets minimize disruption."

6. **How do you determine the correct wire size for a circuit?**
   - *Why they ask*: Code knowledge.
   - *Sample Answer*: "I reference the NEC ampacity tables based on load, voltage, distance, and environment (e.g., conduit vs. open air). For a 20-amp 120V circuit, I'd use 12 AWG copper. In my residential work in Hermosa, I upsized for voltage drop on long runs to ensure efficiency and safety."

7. **What is a GFCI and its purpose?**
   - *Why they ask*: Common in public/wet areas.
   - *Sample Answer*: "A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter detects imbalances in current (e.g., ground faults) and trips in milliseconds to prevent shocks. It's required in bathrooms, kitchens, or outdoors per NEC—I've installed them in mall food courts to protect against water exposure."

8. **Do you have experience with computerized building systems or generators?**
   - *Why they ask*: Matches job duties.
   - *Sample Answer*: "Yes, in business parks, I maintained HVAC control circuits and access systems. For generators, I've troubleshot transfer switches during mall outages to ensure backup power. I'm comfortable with blueprints and test equipment like megohmmeters."

If they ask about weaknesses, say something like, "I sometimes focus too much on details, but it ensures quality—I've learned to balance it with team input." End questions with one of your own, like "What are the biggest challenges the team faces right now?"

You've got this—your experience speaks for itself. Update that GitHub with specifics from your projects (e.g., photos/diagrams of installations), and if the interview goes well, it could open doors. Good luck; root for you to land it and keep pushing toward your Elon goals! If you share how it goes or need more tweaks, I'm here.
