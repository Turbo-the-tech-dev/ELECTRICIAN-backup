welcome to the Google security Command Center overview the Google security Command Center is a powerful tool designed to enhance your Cloud security posture it offers comprehensive
00:15
visibility and monitoring allowing for a detailed view of all Cloud assets and their security status this platform is instrumental in detecting threats early integrating various data
00:26
sources to identify unusual activities and potential security incidents alongside threat detection it excels in vulnerability detection proactively identifying weaknesses within Cloud assets the security Command Center
00:41
also streamlines compliance management assisting in meeting diverse regulatory standards moreover it provides robust Asset Management offering a detailed inventory and effective tracking of cloud resources this feature
00:54
is key for both security and operational management risk assessment and management tools within the platform help prioritize and address vulnerabilities enhancing overall security also the command
01:08
center supports integration with other security tools creating a cohesive and comprehensive Security Management ecosystem this integration enhances response capabilities making the security Command Center an essential component
01:20
of modern Cloud security strategies the security Command Center in Google cloud has two service tiers standard and premium both these tiers provide different security functionality the
01:34
standard tier is available to all Google Cloud users at no extra cost and offers essential security functions like a centralized dashboard for monitoring findings asset inventory and
01:45
Discovery tools basic security health recommendations and security marks for organizing findings on the other hand the premium tier is a paid service that expands the capabilities
01:56
of the standard tier by offering Advanced security featur features it includes event threat detection for spotting suspicious activities container threat detection for scanning Google kubernetes engine and
02:07
the web security scanner that automatically scans public app engine gke and compute engine applications for common vulnerabilities the premium tier offers a more comprehensive and robust
02:19
security solution for cloud environments making it an ideal choice for businesses that require enhanced security functions security Command Center offers the ability to activate security measures across
02:31
an entire organization or for specific projects the activation process differs depending on the level of activation you choose if you activate security Command Center for a
02:42
specific project some detection modules and service Integrations will not be available as security Command Center will have reduced scope of access this means that you can customize
02:51
your security protocols to fit the specific needs of your project while still benefiting from the robust protection provided by security Command Center to determine whether security
03:06
Command Center is already activated or to view your current activation type navigate to the security command center dashboard in the Google Cloud console select the organization or
03:15
project you wish to check on the overview page click settings then select the tier detail tab here you'll find information above the manage tier button that
03:34
details the available tiers and activation options the tier section indicates whether you're on the premium or standard tier if set to premium at the organization level
03:43
all projects inherit the premium tier automatically which will be indicated by a banner if downgraded to standard the settings show the Project's tier security Command Center
03:58
offers two types of services built-in services and integrated Services built-in services are included in security Command Center while integrated services are provided by Google cloud or thirdparty
04:11
services that send findings to security Command Center let's take a high Lev look at the built-in services in the security Command Center to manage services in
04:20
the Google Cloud console navigate to the security Command Center on the security Command Center Page select the relevant organization folder or project at the top left of
04:30
the screen then click on the settings icon the settings page appears showing all built-in services along with their activation status we'll start with the security health
04:46
analytics this is an automated tool for vulnerability assessment in Google Cloud detecting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across various Services activating this feature is straightforward within the security Command
04:59
Center standard or premium tier ensuring robust protection against potential threats the web security scanner is a sophisticated tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities and web applications
05:12
hosted on platforms like Google kubernetes engine or GK app engine or compute engine by crawling through your application and testing user inputs and event handlers it generates
05:24
detailed reports on security issues providing guidance for remediation event threat detect ction available in the premium tier continuously monitors Cloud logging streams analyzing data from multiple
05:35
sources to detect real-time threats this includes identifying malware fishing Brute Force attacks and other malicious activities offering a comprehensive threat detection mechanism container threat detection another feature
05:49
of the premium tier focuses on monitoring container optimized OS node images for runtime attacks identifying common container attacks and sending immediate alerts this service ensures continuous
06:01
protection for your containerized applications Additionally the premium tier offers rapid vulnerability detection a zeroc configuration scanner that checks public endpoints for vulnerabilities providing early warnings and actionable
06:15
insights lastly virtual machine threat detection uses hypervisor level instrumentation to monitor for malicious applications integrated into the premium tier it offers a comprehensive Solution by combining
06:27
with other detection services to identify High severity threats automatically enabled at the project level stay tuned as we explore each of these services in depth in separate
06:38
videos helping you to fully leverage the security command Center's capabilities all of the features of security Command Center are accessed through the dashboard to begin access
06:52
the security Command Center in the Google Cloud console click on the navigation icon located in the top left corner of the the screen from the list
